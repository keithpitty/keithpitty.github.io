# kpdotcom-jekyll

This is the Jekyll site that I have developed to generate content for [my website](https://keithpitty.com).

I've written a [post](https://keithpitty.com/blog/archives/2023-04-06-migrating-to-jekyll) to describe how I migrated from an [old, lovingly maintained Rails application](https://github.com/keithpitty/kpdotcom).
