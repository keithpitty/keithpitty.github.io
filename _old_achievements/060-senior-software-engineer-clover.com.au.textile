I joined "Clover.com.au":https://www.clover.com.au in June 2019.

During my first few months the bulk of my work was focussed on re-engineering the main Ruby on Rails application to support many advisors. This included:

* designing and implementing database table and ActiveRecord class relationships to support multi-tenancy
* converting keys for all tables from integers to UUIDs
* merging tables from two PostgreSQL databases into one
* planning the steps needed to enable the platform to support many tenants
