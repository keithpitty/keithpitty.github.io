Keith is an outstanding Engineering Leader.

I was lucky to work alongside Keith for close to a year, managing a large team of SREs.

Keith possesses an extraordinary amount of development, delivery and process experience. He was able to instantly apply that knowledge to:

* Improve the way our team worked together, levelling up the facilitation in our retros and improving the way we communicated across our distributed team
* Improve the way we classified and tracked work
* Set clear delivery goals and helped the team achieve them

Alongside that, Keith is a caring and knowledgeable manager of people. Keith spends quality time with his reports, mentoring them, working with them to grow and succeed.
