From the moment I met Keith, it was very clear that he cared deeply about the people around him and the broader community. I was not at all surprised to find him very active in the conversations that led us to start a new non-profit organisation to further the Ruby community in Australia. We could not have chosen a better person to be our founding president, and it was my privilege to work alongside him. As if that was not enough, Keith also organised Rails Camp 9 and the inaugural RubyConf AU. Few people can say they have done as much as Keith to help the Ruby community in Australia.
