Keith was immensely helpful as soon as he joined Clover. We had a big Rails migration project that had been stalled for quite some time, but with his experience the project was quickly unstuck, and progress made on this business critical migration.

He also helped mature our remote working practices, with better routines and better communication.

I enjoyed the time I worked with Keith and hope I can work with him again in the future.
