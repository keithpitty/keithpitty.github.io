p. How effective is your daily stand-up meeting? Is it energising the team or does it have a "going through the motions" feel to it?

p. In his book, "_The Agile Samurai_":http://pragprog.com/titles/jtrap/the-agile-samurai, Jonathan Rasmusson recommends that each person tell the rest of the team:

* What you did to change the world yesterday
* How you are going to crush it today
* How you are going to blast though any obstacles unfortunate enough to be standing in your way

p. It's a change of emphasis that I think is worth trying. As Jonathan says, it is a demonstration of commitment to the team and "dramatically increases the chances of you getting it done."

p. However, if being so positive feels uncomfortable or forced, this probably indicates that there are other problems affecting the team's morale that need to be dealt with.
