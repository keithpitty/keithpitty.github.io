[Corey Haines](https://twitter.com/coreyhaines) is well known for
championing the intensive software practice events known as
[coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/). He shares his experiences from
these sessions of the practice of simply designing software in the book
[*Understanding the 4 Rules of Simple
Design*](https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign).

The four rules, originated by [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck)
in the late 90s, are expressed concisely by Corey as follows:

1.  Tests pass
2.  Expresses intent
3.  No duplication (DRY)
4.  Small

Corey has observed patterns that have emerged from solutions to
[Conway’s Game of
Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) during many
coderetreat sessions and he relates these back to the four rules.

Examples include the strategy of **reification** to eliminate knowledge
duplication and noticing how the resultant classes act as **behavior
attractors**. There are many more nuggets in Corey’s book so, rather
than listing them here, I encourage you to read the book.

Naturally, Corey is not the only software luminary, other than Kent
Beck, to have written about the four rules of simple design. Indeed,
Corey refers to two

[articles](http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/2013/12/07/putting-an-age-old-battle-to-rest/)
by [Joe Rainsberger](https://twitter.com/jbrains) that have influenced
his thinking.

I like the way Joe expands upon these rules in a practical sense and
distills them to their essence. As Joe concludes, good simple design
practice boils down to this:

> **Remove duplication and improve names in small cycles.**

That sounds like good advice to me.
