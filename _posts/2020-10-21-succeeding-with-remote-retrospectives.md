Obviously 2020 has been a challenging year all round.

In particular, when work groups meet to reflect on their recent work,
now that these retrospectives are taking place virtually, extra
challenges present themselves.

Recently, as part of the [mini-LAST #2
conference](https://confengine.com/mini-last-2/schedule), I
[presented](https://speakerdeck.com/keithpitty/succeeding-with-remote-retrospectives)
what was partly some of my suggestions and partly a facilitation of
discussions about succeeding with remote retrospectives. I promised to
share the outcomes. Hence this blog post.

## Motivation

The first of three aspects that I covered was a fundamental one. Remote
or in person, why would a team want to hold a retrospective anyway?

### Share recent successes

In my view a good, positive reason to hold a retrospective is to reflect
on recent successes. I recall occasions in my career when, at the end of
a project, the team celebrated with a lunch paid for by the company. In
these times of more iterative software development, I think it’s healthy
to regularly celebrate recent achievements as a team. This can be done
as part of a retrospective and helps to build team morale.

### Reduce frustration

As well as sharing reflections on things that went well, a key
motivation to hold a retrospective may to allow team members to voice
their views about sub-optimal experiences. Providing a forum in which to
let people to get things “off their chest” is important so that
negativity does not build.

### Emphasise the Prime Directive

Whilst I think it’s useful to allow people to comment on negative
aspects of their recent work, it’s important that the team approach the
retrospective in good spirit. This is reflected in what Norm Kerth
proposed as the *Prime Directive*:

> “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that
> everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the
> time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the
> situation at hand.”

So, it’s not a witch hunt! A healthy retrospective needs to acknowledge
this as a premise.

### Discuss questions

During the last iteration, sprint or whatever name your team has given
to the period of time which you are reflecting upon, questions may have
arisen. Encouraging team members to share uncertainties may lead to
fruitful discussion, perhaps resulting in answers or actions that can
lead to improvement.

### Ideas from the audience

Having presented a few of my suggestions, I opened up discussion to seek
more ideas from the audience about motivations for holding
retrospectives. These included:

-   to improve;
-   because it’s expected by management;
-   to build team rapport;
-   to bond as a team

The second suggestion was somewhat cynical but nevertheless important to
recognise. Unless there is genuine desire from the team to engage in a
retrospective, it’s less likely to result in positive outcomes like
improving teamwork.

## Remote Challenges

Unsurprisingly the major aspect of my talk was to consider the
challenges to holding a retrospective remotely.

### Equal participation

It’s important that each person participating in the retrospective feels
that they are getting a fair go. In a remote retrospective this implies
that each person participates via their own video connection.

Before the onset of COVID-19 I can recall many retrospectives in which I
was the only remote participant. Depending on the camera position in the
room where everyone else was, this was at times quite disconcerting.
Many times I felt like an outsider, having to say “excuse me” when I
wanted to get a word in. And then everyone else looked at the camera.
Contrast this everyone connecting with their own video camera as is more
likely to be the case now that everyone is working from home.

Happily, I can also recall being part of retrospectives where I was the
only remote participant and the co-located participants each took their
laptop to a different part of the office and connected as if they were
remote. It’s easy enough to do but, in my view, a very important step.

### Audio and video

As with any online meeting, it helps to ensure that audio and video
technology is working well. Invest in good microphones, make sure your
software is configured to use them and prefer ethernet to wifi
connections. Simple attention to these details will enable you to
communicate seamlessly. For example, I know that in my home office the
wifi connection in my office is not sufficient for smooth video.

Another simple tip is to set up your computer so that the camera is at a
good height to enable others to see you at a natural angle.

Do everything you can to avoid distractions from good verbal and visual
communication.

### Retro tool

In a retrospective where everyone’s in the same physical room, a white
board and post-it notes can be used.

When at least one participant is remote, this low fidelity approach
breaks down. An online tool is needed. Whilst general purpose tools can
be used, I favour one that is built for the purpose.

A couple of months ago this tweet posed a question about which remote
retro tool people preferred. Now at this point I need to disclose that I
am a co-founder of one of the tools mentioned,
[RemoteRetro](https://remoteretro.io/). How I came to be a co-founder of
this tool is another story, which I may make the subject of another
post.

Suffice to say, to enable everyone to equally participate in a remote
retrospective, you’ll need to choose one or more tools for online
collaboration.

### Facilitation

Facilitation is even more important when participants are remote. The
facilitator will need to guide the team’s use of the retro tool as well
as communicate effectively with participants via the video tool.

### Variety

What format will the retro take? Don’t allow retros to become boring by
choosing the same format each time.

For example, RemoteRetro, as well as allowing custom formats to be
created, offers four pre-set formats:

-   Good/Bad/Actions/Questions
-   Start/Stop/Continue
-   Mad/Sad/Glad
-   Liked/Learned/Loathed/Longed For

### Share ideas

In order to promote useful discussion the facilitator will need to
encourage all participants to contribute ideas via the retro tool.

### Facilitate discussion

Once ideas have been shared via the retro tool, at the very lest the
facilitator needs to guide the resulting discussion.

### Ideas from the audience

When we further discussed remote challenges as a group, the following
ideas were generated:

-   make sure that genuine variety occurs, not just different formats or
    recipes
-   changing the focus of each retrospective can help
-   we need to follow up ideas that require action
-   a live, anonymous, interactive polling tool called
    [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) was recommended to collect
    views from the team
-   other retro tools that were recommended included [Metro
    Retro](https://metroretro.io/), [FunRetro](https://funretro.io/) and
    [RetroBoard](https://retroboard.io/)
-   general purpose tools that audience members use for retros included
    [MURAL](https://www.mural.co/) and [Miro](https://miro.com/)

## Enabling Improvement

To round out this presentation and discussion, I wanted to focus on
improvement. Quite simply, if a retrospective doesn’t result in
improvements for the team, it’s hard to justify holding it in the first
place.

### Note action items

Capture suggestions for actions arising from the discussion.

Use your chosen tool(s) to note action items and agree on who should be
assigned to them.

### Support for tracking action items

It’s important that action items are completed before the next
retrospective. Otherwise, the team can become demotivated. They may
start questioning the point of holding retrospectives in the first
place.

A combination of using tools well and personal as well as team
commitment to following through must support good intentions.

### Ideas from the audience

Some ideas about enabling improvement that the audience suggested were:

-   don’t hold retros at 4pm on a Friday!
-   commit to realistic actions so that improvement has more chance of
    resulting
-   use the [Heart of Agile](https://heartofagile.com/) as a prism for
    enabling improvement
-   use a Futurespective approach

## In Conclusion

I would like to thank all who were involved in the mini-LAST #2 online
conference, especially Ed Wong for enabling me to present. To those who
listened and participated, a big thank you for what you contributed.
Even though I’ve been an enthusiastic participant and facilitator of
remote retrospectives for quite a few years, I know I still have plenty
to learn.

## Postscript

Speaking of having plenty to learn, this morning I was alerted to the
fact that Aino Vonge Corry’s [*Retrospectives
Antipatterns*](https://twitter.com/AntipatternsRet) book was available.
Having anticipated it for some time, I quickly took the opportunity to
purchase it and start reading it. I’m sure that there will be many
nuggets therein from which I can improve my own facilitation of
retrospectives.
