The COVID-19 pandemic has obviously brought remote working into focus.
Many meetups have also been forced to move to use online mediums. Of
interest to me is that this month’s Sydney
[Rorosyd](https://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/events/269028394/)
meetup will focus on how COVID-19 has affected workers.

The meetup will include an interactive forum about “issues,
opportunities, and challenges during the pandemic”.

Some of the questions to be discussed will include:

-   What do you do to socialise remotely and what tools do you use? Do
    you plan virtual events?
-   How do you get into “work mode” working from home? Do you have a
    routine that gets you ready for the day?
-   Has the collaboration in your teams changed since working from home?
    How has it changed?
-   How are you keeping taking care of yourself during COVID, (mental
    health, learning, side projects)?

As someone who has worked remotely since 2008 I have a keen perspective
on these questions. So I thought I would lay out some thoughts in this
post in advance of the meetup.

## Reflecting on Remote Work during COVID-19

Before I say more about working remotely during COVID-19 it is important
for me to stress that because I have had the advantage of working
remotely for many years, some of my recent experience is not that
different from my experience during the previous 12 years.

However, perhaps that is one reason why I think I can offer a useful
perspective about work during the pandemic.

### Remote social connection

I’ve always felt that there’s something very valuable about mixing with
work colleagues in a social environment, whether it’s at a pub or
elsewhere. Obviously when all members of the work group are forced to
work remotely from each other, the lack of such gatherings is brought
into sharp focus.

Last week I realised that my own work group had been missing an element
of social interaction. Before the COVID-19 restrictions came into force,
I would visit the office in Melbourne every few months, enabling some
important face-to-face interaction. It has now been nearly three months
since my last visit and the next is unlikely to be any time soon. So, we
have agreed to a monthly online gathering which has only two
stipulations. Each member of the group will bring their beverage of
choice and the online gathering will be strictly social. I’m hopeful
that it will prove to be a fruitful bonding exercise. We shall see!

### Remote work routines

My work group is currently all in the same time zone on the east coast
of Australia. Several elements guide our daily work routine. First of
all, we have a custom that when we start work for the day we announce
that fact in our main Slack channel and set ourselves to active. This
signal in Slack is a simple yet effective way of letting our colleagues
know that we are working and available to collaborate.

Another key part of the “getting ready for the day” is our standup
meeting, which we hold via a video call. Whilst we don’t conform to the
traditional expectation of standing up, we definitely keep the meeting
brief by sharing our main Trello screen and taking turns to let each
other know where we are up to.

Our daily standup meeting is scheduled for 10am, which I consider to be
a civilised time of day. Personally, I’m not an early starter. I tend to
start work between 9am and 9:30am most days and usually work through
until after 6pm. I find that our team’s 10am startup meeting is an
importance cadence for our work pattern. It gives us a chance to get on
the same page, understand what each other is aiming to achieve for the
remainder of the day and then allows us to all get on with it.

For the remainder of the day, we communicate using whichever means is
most effective. It may be via Slack, Trello, GitHub or, when the need
arises, via a video call.

### Remote collaboration

Has our team’s collaboration changed since we we all began working from
home most of the time?

I find this question difficult to answer because I’m so used to working
from home. However, I really don’t think it has much for us.

More generally, I will be interested to hear more about other people’s
experiences. I know that some colleagues in the industry have found it
difficult to adjust to working from home, especially those who live
alone and are used to depending on social interaction in the workplace.

### Taking care of yourself

How am I taking care of myself?

Well, I do try to maintain a discipline of doing my morning stretches
and getting some exercise, even if it’s just walking the dog. And, in my
case I’ve been fortunate to get in a few games of golf. Simple actions
like getting outside and watering plants in my garden help my mental
health as well.

As far as more work-related activities goes, I’ve been doing some work
on the codebase that supports this site. I also provide occasional
assistance to my startup partner on our side project,
[RemoteRetro](https://remoteretro.io), which, by the way, is an even
more useful tool during these times.

And there’s always something work-related that I’m reading.

## Remote Work in General

### Advantages

I find it interesting to observe how people are adapting to remote work.
To me it has many obvious advantages apart from helping prevent the
spread of disease!

Here are a few that come easily to mind:

-   avoiding unnecessary travel time
-   allowing more time with family
-   allowing more time to do household chores
-   reducing my carbon-footprint

### Acceptance

Acceptance of remote work by managers was a sticking point in many
organisations prior to COVID-19. It will be interesting to see how much
this attitude will have changed after the crisis has passed.

An obvious reason for a lack of acceptance in the past relates to
trusting workers to actually spend the time that they’re paid to work by
working. As software developers, it should be obvious how we can
demonstrate that we are producing work of value.

Collectively, if we can use the tools at our disposal to demonstrate
that we are being productive workers, hopefully greater acceptance will
result.
