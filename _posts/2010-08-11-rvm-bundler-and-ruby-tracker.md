## Lightning Talk at rorosyd

Here are the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/keithpitty/rvm-bundler-ruby-tracker) from a lightning talk I gave at
[rorosyd](http://rubyonrails.com.au/2010/8/3/sydney-meetup-august-2010)
last night. Having found [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/),
[Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and [Ruby
Tracker](http://rubytracker.com/) to be a useful set of tools this year,
I thought Iâ€™d take the opportunity to share my experiences. And, as I
mentioned during the talk, kudos to Mikel Lindsaar for his [blog
post](http://lindsaar.net/2010/3/31/bundle_me_some_sanity) earlier this
year which alerted me to the power of creating a `.rvmrc` file.
