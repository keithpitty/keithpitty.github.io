## Background

A few years ago I wrote a brief post about [committed
stand-ups](/blog/archives/2011-05-13-committed-stand-ups) in which I
drew on the work of Jonathan Rasmusson and posed the following
questions:

> How effective is your daily stand-up meeting?

> Is it energising the team or does it have a “going through the
> motions” feel to it?

Part of Jonathan’s answer was to, rather than simply let the team know
what you plan to do today, tell them *“how you are going to crush it
today”*.

The change of emphasis that Jonathan suggested can only work if
individuals in the team genuinely feel like “crushing it” for the sake
of the team. Unsurprisingly, barriers can exist which prevent effective
stand-ups.

## Barriers

### Size

The reason for standing up whilst meeting is to keep the discussion
short and to the point. If the meeting drags on for too long,
participants are likely to become distracted. Obviously, the larger the
team, the harder it is going to be to enable each member of the team to
focus on what others are saying.

In my view, any more than about six people in a standup reduces its
effectiveness.

### Disparate Activities

Good stand-ups typically involve participants who are all working on the
same project. If someone else in the stand-up starts talking about an
activity that is unrelated to what the another in the group is doing, it
is only natural that the listener will be inclined to tune out.

### Leader

Stand-ups can become less effective if always led by a manager. In my
experience, they work better if the role of convening the stand-up is
shared throughout the team.

### Technology

Whilst stand-ups can effectively include remote participants, of course
they will break down if the technology fails. When this happens, those
that are remote can be left laughing or thinking, “what was the point of
that?”

## Recommendations

In my experience, the most effective stand-ups have been in small teams
focussed on the same project.

-   Keep the number of participants to a maximum of about six; certainly
    don’t let it get to double figures
-   Organise stand-ups around projects rather than amongst teams who are
    working on unrelated activities
-   Share the role of stand-up convenor throughout the team
-   For stand-ups involving remote participants, ensure that the
    computer hosting the video conferencing software is stable, and
    attach a good microphone and speakers so that everyone can hear well

I recall that during my early experiences of eXtreme Programming in
about 2001, the Daily Stand-up practice was one of those that I found
most effective. In my view, it can still be very valuable, provided
barriers aren’t inadvertently put in its way.
