Yes, currently I have hours free in my diary to be of service.

A web application development project that has been keeping me busy for
a good part of the last year and a half appears to be reaching the point
when the application will be launched in the very near future. I hope to
be in a position to write more about that project soon.

Meanwhile, if you, your company or someone you know needs the services
of a software developer with a passion for solving problems and helping
people with software please [get in
touch](http://keithpitty.com/contact). Maybe you already have an idea
that needs to be transformed into software. Maybe you have problems with
your existing software that need to be fixed. Or perhaps your software
project needs more effective management. With more than 25 years of
experience in the software industry there is a good chance that I can
help. Elsewhere on this site you can find more information about my
[professional background](http://keithpitty.com/about) and the sort of
[services](http://keithpitty.com/services) I provide.

I look forward to hearing from you!
