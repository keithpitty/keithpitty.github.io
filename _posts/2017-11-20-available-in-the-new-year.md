The new year promises to bring new challenges.

Yes, having contributed to [The Conversation’s development
team](https://theconversation.com/columns/building-the-conversation-534)
as a contractor since June 2015, I will be moving on in late January, or
earlier if I am able to provide fair notice.

I’ve very much enjoyed the opportunity to work with [The
Conversation](https://theconversation.com) over the last two and a half
years and will have fond memories of collaborating with development
colleagues as well as editors of the various editions around the globe.

What’s next?

I’m open to both consulting and permanent roles. If you’re looking for a
seasoned, passionate software developer who has a [track record](/about)
for helping people by solving problems, please [get in touch](/contact).
