I’ve been thinking about Jerry Weinberg’s writing over the last few
days, since his passing moved many including myself to words in his
honour.

His words inspired me.

I know that I’ve dipped into the pages of [*The Secrets of
Consulting*](https://www.amazon.com.au/Secrets-Consulting-Giving-Getting-Advice/dp/0932633013)
many times over the years. I should probably, in the near future, take
time to refresh my memory of the excellent advice that I know that tome
contains. And I know there are many other books of Jerry’s that are
worth reading or re-reading.

However, of all Jerry’s writing, there is one book that stands out to
me. I was moved to write about it back in 2007 in a now defunct blog.
Fortunately I have an extract of the text.

I introduced my post with a a reference to a picture of a beautiful
stone wall in my back yard. Whilst I’ve lost the original photo, here is
a fresh one of the same wall:

And here’s what I wrote:

Although I never met Jerry, that’s the lasting impression I have of him.
Passion poured from the pages he wrote.

The software development community is very fortunate that Jerry has left
such a wonderful written legacy. If you have a thirst for learning from
a [pioneer of a people-oriented approach to
programming](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633420/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0)
about topics ranging from
[consulting](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633013/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i1),
[becoming a technical
leader](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633013/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i1),
[systems
thinking](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633498/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i3),

[exploring

and, of course,
[writing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/093263365X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i7),
amongst [many
others](https://www.amazon.com/Gerald-M.-Weinberg/e/B000AP8TZ8), I
thoroughly recommend reading his books.

Jerry may be gone but his words will live on.
