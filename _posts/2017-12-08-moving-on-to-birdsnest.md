For the cast of thousands who hang off every word that I write on this
site I am delighted to announce that I will be commencing a new role in
the new year!

In January I will be starting work as a Senior Software Developer with
[Birdsnest](https://www.birdsnest.com.au/), an online retailing company
based in Cooma, NSW.

Whilst I will be based at my home office on the NSW Central Coast, I
will be making regular visits to Cooma to work with staff on-site,
especially the software development team.

Birdsnest is an inspiring company that [offers a unique online shopping
experience](https://www.birdsnest.com.au/our-story/about-us).

I look forward to working with the development team to help them build
upon their successes to date.
