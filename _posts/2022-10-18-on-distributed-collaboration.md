## Background

Back in my early days of experiencing [eXtreme
Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/), I enjoyed the way our
team at Cirrus Technologies would gather at the same time each morning
for our daily stand-up ritual. Mind you, this was two decades ago. We
were co-located, and our team did stand up, passing a “talking token”
from person to person, around our circle.

As practitioners of XP, we observed what was [proposed for stand-up
meetings](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/standupmeeting.html).
In particular, we took notice that:

> “Communication among the entire team is the purpose of the stand up
> meeting. A stand up meeting every morning is used to communicate
> problems, solutions, and promote team focus. Everyone stands up in a
> circle to avoid long discussions. It is more efficient to have one
> short meeting that every one is required to attend than many meetings
> with a few developers each.”

Fast forward to 2022, when many teams, including the one within which I
work, are all working from home. In my team’s case, as well as us all
working from home, we are split across three time zones. A few are in
New Zealand, several are on the East coast of Australia, and one is in
Perth. So, we are a long way from being co-located.

This presents challenges compared with the co-located morning stand-up
of years gone by.

## Collaboration in a distributed team

A team that is split across many different locations and several time
zones presents challenges for collaboration in general.

Gone are the days when a team member could simply tap a colleague on the
shoulder and ask for help, with this request naturally unfolding into a
collaborative conversation.

In a distributed team, collaboration requires deliberate, conscious
effort.

Personalities differ. Some folks are by nature more content to work
independently, striving to solve problems on their own. Others crave
connection. Whatever an individual’s preference, at some point
collaboration of some form will be necessary, even if it is of an
asynchronous form such as a review of a pull request.

Then again, arguably, collaboration should begin well before this during
the evolution of a solution to a problem. Early feedback avoids time
wasted going down paths that eventually prove to be unacceptable to
peers.

## Communication vs Collaboration

In a distributed team it can sometimes be challenging to promote
sufficient communication, let alone collaboration. That begs the
question, what’s the difference between communication and collaboration?

I like the way Rick Kick and Kennedy Collins express it in their recent
article about [lack of trust and collaboration slowing down product
growth](https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/03-product-v-engineering.html):

> “Teams that meet regularly to discuss their work are communicating.
> Teams that openly seek and provide input while actively working are
> collaborating. Having regular status meetings where teams give updates
> on different components doesn’t mean a team is collaborative.
> Collaboration happens when teams actively try to understand each other
> and openly seek and provide input while working.”

When we focus on that definition in the context of a distributed team,
it brings home the need to be very deliberate about collaborating. We
need to reach out to each other. We need to actively try to understand
each other. We need to openly seek and provide input from and to each
other.

In a distributed team, that requires continued, deliberate effort.

## Why Collaborate?

But why collaborate at all?

If you’re a member of a team, you’re going to be expected to collaborate
at some point in order to have your work accepted. In the case of a
solution expressed as code, there will most likely be an expectation
that a colleague review your work before it is approved, and
implemented.

So, at a minimum, there is likely to be an expectation to collaborate in
order for your work to be accepted.

However, let’s consider the potential benefits of collaborating. By
reaching out to colleagues, we may:

-   receive valuable early feedback about an intended approach to
    solving a problem;
-   gain valuable insights about system architecture;
-   understand how a colleague’s professional experience can help;
-   learn from a colleague who knows more about an area of technical
    expertise;
-   learn from a colleague who has greater domain knowledge

In doing so, we may also strengthen professional relationships within
the team.

## Connection

Whilst some humans are happy to live as hermits, most crave various
degrees of connection. As members of distributed teams, we would be well
advised to be mindful of this aspect.

Without the opportunities that present themselves in a physical office,
we need to compensate. From time to time, hopefully we will have
opportunities to meet face to face as a team. However, in our day to
day, distributed work, we will need to be deliberate in creating
opportunities to connect via the communication tools at our disposal.

I think that the challenge to create sufficient connection in a
distributed team is vital. I hope to return to this theme in later
posts.

## References

This has been a short post in which I have shared a few thoughts about
distributed collaboration. If you’re interested in this topic, you may
like to delve into the following two books that I have, like many books,
started but not finished reading:

-   \_[From Chaos to Successful Distributed Agile Teams: Collaborate to
    Deliver](https://www.amazon.com.au/Chaos-Successful-Distributed-Agile-Teams/dp/1943487111/_)
    by Johanna Rothman and Mark Kilby
-   \_[Effective Remote Work: For Yourself, Your Team, and Your
    Company](https://pragprog.com/titles/jsrw/effective-remote-work/_)
    by James Stanier

## Conclusion

Remote work is here to stay. Collaboration remains important.
Individuals and teams need to find ways to facilitate distributed
collaboration.
