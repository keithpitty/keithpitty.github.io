Phew! I’ve just about recovered from Rails Camp 9, an event that may be
described as an unconference. It took place over the June long weekend
at Lake Ainsworth near Byron Bay on the NSW far north coast.

For this camp, it was my honour to be one of the organisers.
Fortunately, Rails Camp now has a well-established pattern and there
were many organisers of previous camps willing to help and advise. And I
had a terrific team amongst whom to share the workload.

Nevertheless, for the benefit of future Rails Camp organisers, I thought
I’d share a few recollections of how our team went about organising
Rails Camp 9.

## The Organising Crew

I present the wonderful bunch of Rails hackers who all played their part
in ensuring that Rails Camp 9 was, to use an over-used adjective du
jour, awesome: [Jason Crane](http://twitter.com/snapperwolf), [Scott
Harvey](http://twitter.com/scottharveyco), [Zubin
Henner](http://twitter.com/zenlunacy), [Ben
Hoskings](http://twitter.com/ben_h), [Tim
McEwan](http://twitter.com/tjmcewan), [Elle
Meredith](http://twitter.com/aemeredith), [Keith
Pitty](http://twitter.com/keithpitty) and [Jason
Stirk](http://twitter.com/j_stirk). (Trivia note: half of this crew were
at the inaugural Rails Camp at Somersby in 2007.)

## The Venue: Lake Ainsworth

How did we choose the venue? Once we had settled on the idea of holding
Rails Camp in the Byron Bay area, the locals in the organising crew -
Zubin Henner, Elle Meredith and Jason Stirk - scoured the region looking
for a suitable venue and came up with only one that could accommodate
the numbers we were expecting.

In many respects [Lake
Ainsworth](http://www.dsr.nsw.gov.au/lakeainsworth/index.asp) was a
perfect venue. Nestled between the lake and the beach it had excellent
facilities for our needs. The staff were very helpful and I can really
only think of two negatives: we were obliged to deal with some
unexpected government bureaucracy and we had to hold the camp on a long
weekend.

## How we organised Rails Camp 9

Settling on the venue was half the battle. Happily, as this photo shows,
we were also able to organise the essential ingredients of Rails Camp.

Thanks go to Zubin for organising the beer and Elle for organising the
coffee machine. As for the coffee itself, Jason Crane ensured we had
excellent beans and well trained baristas!

Speaking of essential ingredients, securing the services of Ben Hoskings
to again set up the server and wifi was wonderful. Apart from one brief
power outage during the weekend, everything ran as smooth as clockwork.
So coffee, beer and wifi were sorted, ensuring happy campers!

Some of the other things we did to keep the organisation on track
leading up to the weekend were:

-   Set up a [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/) project, which may have
    been overkill but proved to be invaluable
-   Distributed responsibilities - e.g. finance, sponsorship, ticket
    sales, coffee, beer - to various members of the crew
-   Held regular virtual meetings via IRC, capturing the logs in
    Basecamp for reference
-   Used [Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com),
    [Paypal](http://paypal.com) and a joint bank account to manage
    ticket sales
-   Sent messages and encouraged communication via the [Railscamp Google
    Group](http://groups.google.com/group/railscamp)
-   Sent messages via the [@railscamp_au](http://twitter.com/keithpitty)
    Twitter account
-   Took advantage of [the
    skills](http://railscampteev7.toolmantim.com/) of [Tim
    Lucas](http://twitter.com/toolmantim) and [Daniel
    Bogan](http://twitter.com/waferbaby) to get the t-shirts designed
    and ordered
-   Created a [simple Rails app](http://github.com/keithpitty/rc9peeps)
    that, amongst other things, enabled sending emails to participants
    via MailChimp and facilitated printing lanyard inserts
-   Organised buses to transport campers between Gold Coast airport and
    Lake Ainsworth
-   Created a [Rails Camp 9 Twitter
    list](http://twitter.com/#!/railscamp_au/railscamp9)
-   Organised a welcome BBQ (thanks Zubin) for those who arrived early
    enough on the Friday
-   Thanks to Elle and [Gabe Hollombe](http://twitter.com/gabehollombe),
    provided an [Ideagora app](https://github.com/elle/ideagora) for
    sharing interests, projects and talks

## Running the event

One of the wonderful things about an unconference such as Rails Camp is
that, once it starts, it is largely self-organising. The 146
participants of Rails Camp 9 decided how they would spend the weekend.
Many chose projects to work on and talks to either present or listen to.
Some simply appreciated the opportunity to socialise amongst like-minded
people. And, of course, there were games of
[Werewolf](http://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-849418-Werewolves-Millers-Hollow/dp/B0009Z3M8S)
to be played.

As an organiser, once the camp had started, I found my role was largely
to be alert to the possibility of requests for assistance. Whilst this
did keep me reasonably busy I did have the chance to catch up with and
meet lots of Ruby people from around Austalia and New Zealand. I also
managed, thanks to [Phil Oye](http://twitter.com/philoye), to remember
how to use [Bananajour](https://github.com/toolmantim/bananajour) so
that I could submit a couple of patches to Ideagora. And, there was one
particularly epic game of Werewolf (thanks
[Carl](http://twitter.com/cjwoodward)) to remember.

## Thanks to our Sponsors

A wrap of Rails Camp 9 would not be complete without thanking our
sponsors. So, on behalf of the organising crew, I extend a big thank you
to:

-   [Thoughtworks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/)
-   [Five Senses Coffee](http://www.fivesenses.com.au/)
-   [Blue Box](http://www.bluebox.net/)
-   [Rosenfeld Media](http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/)
-   [Ninefold](http://ninefold.com/)
-   [Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/)
-   [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/)

## Future Australian Rails Camps

Another heartening thing about the Australian Rails Camp community is
that by the end of one camp a volunteer invariably steps up to take
responsibility for organising the next camp. Happily, [Sebastian von
Conrad](http://twitter.com/vonconrad) did just that at Lake Ainsworth,
agreeing to take possession of the virtual baton to ensure that Rails
Camp 10 happens near Adelaide.

Not only that, there have already been discussions about the possibility
of Rails Camp 11 in Queensland and Rails Camp 12 in Tasmania!
