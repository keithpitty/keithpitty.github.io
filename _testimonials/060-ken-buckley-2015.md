Keith Pitty and his company Cockatoo Software have worked closely with
Healthworks over recent years to develop and upgrade one of our critical
web platforms. He is an experienced and gifted programmer and he worked
closely with us to scope, develop and trouble shoot as required. I
wouldnâ€™t hesitate to recommend him.
