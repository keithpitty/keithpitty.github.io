As one of Keith’s peers at Advanced Software Engineering, I could always
count on Keith’s professional integrity, and his ability to be able to
get the required results for our customers, in either a pre-sales role,
a consulting assignment, or in delivery of teaching materials. Keith was
always a pleasure to work with, and I found him to be very knowledgeable
across his many areas of expertise.
