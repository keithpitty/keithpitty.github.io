<p>

During more than seven years with Cirrus Technologies I contributed to
teams developing software using Javaâ€™s standard (Java SE) and enterprise
(Java EE) editions for many clients. I also provided services as an
instructor.

</p>
<p>

For example, I:

</p>
<ul>
<li>

played a leading role in developing a Health Insurance Comparison web
application;

</li>
<li>

contributed to the development, support and enhancement of a Station
Turnout System used by fire brigade personnel;

</li>
<li>

analysed, designed, developed and enhanced parts of a Sales Contact web
application for a major insurance company;

</li>
<li>

managed several web application projects for a NSW government department
as well as well as developing much of the software and mentoring
development staff;

</li>
<li>

developed components of several Java EE sub-systems that contributed to
replacing COBOL applications for a medium-sized insurance company;

</li>
<li>

delivered many public Java SE, Java EE and WebSphere courses on behalf
of a major global technology corporation.

</li>
</ul>
<p>

In my spare time from 2000 onwards I explored many Java technologies,
especially open source frameworks. In 2004 I began to take an increasing
interest in the Ruby programming language and the Ruby on Rails web
application framework.
