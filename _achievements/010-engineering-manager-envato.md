heading: Engineering Manager, Envato (2021 - present)
---

I joined [Envato](https://envato.com/) in July 2021 in the role of an
Engineering Manager.

Having spent most of my first year in the Infrastructure team, in June
2022, following a company-wide restructure, I moved to a Tech Services
team. In September 2022 I moved to the Market team. Watch this space for
further details.

Whilst in the Infrastructure team, my work included:

-   managing seven direct reports
-   sharing the management of the Infrastructure team with another
    Engineering Manager
-   leading improvements to the team’s workflow processes
-   giving a presentation to leaders within the Engineering cohort about
    the team’s use of the AWS Cloud Development Kit
-   developing working relationships with vendors
-   facilitating the revision of on-call and technical support rosters
-   hiring new Site Reliability Engineers and introducing them to Envato
    and the Infrastructure team
-   facilitating team retrospectives
-   familiarising myself with the infrastructure that the team’s SREs
    supported
