heading: Engineering Manager, Envato (2021 - present)
---

I joined [Envato](https://envato.com/) in July 2021 in the role of an
Engineering Manager.

From July 2024 I managed a Find Experience team of six engineers 
within the Search and Content Management domain. Watch this space for
further details in due course.

In mid-2022, following a company-wide restructure, I briefly moved to a 
Tech Services team before moving to the Market team.

During my time in the Market team, I:

- managed six direct reports
- co-managed the Market team
- contributed to improvements in the team's processes
- collaborated with the team's Product Manager to plan, prioritise
  and track maintenance, tactical and strategic initiatives
- collaborated with another Engineering Manager to introduce more
  Engineers to the on-call roster
- provided guidance to Engineers who have been leading initiatives
- facilitated Envato's sponsorship of, and involvement in RubyConf AU 2023
- facilitated Envato's Tech Leadership Book Club
- collaborated with others to improve Envato's Incident Management
  capabilities

From July 2021 until June 2023 I co-managed the Infrastructure team.
My work included:

-   managing seven direct reports
-   sharing the management of the Infrastructure team with another
    Engineering Manager
-   leading improvements to the team’s workflow processes
-   giving a presentation to leaders within the Engineering cohort about
    the team’s use of the AWS Cloud Development Kit
-   developing working relationships with vendors
-   facilitating the revision of on-call and technical support rosters
-   hiring new Site Reliability Engineers and introducing them to Envato
    and the Infrastructure team
-   facilitating team retrospectives
-   familiarising myself with the infrastructure that the team’s SREs
    supported
