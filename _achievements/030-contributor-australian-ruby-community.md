Since late 2006 I have been a keen participant in the Australian Ruby
community.

Most recently, I was delighted to present a talk entitled [*What were
they
thinking?*](https://keithpitty.com/blog/archives/2019-02-20-reflecting-on-rubyconf-au-2019)
at [RubyConf Australia 2019](https://rubyconf.org.au/2019).

One of the highlights of my career was leading the organisation of
[RubyConf Australia 2013](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/2013), the
inaugural Ruby conference in Australia, which was held in Melbourne in
February 2013. This conference was held yearly until the pandemic,
attracting speakers from all over the globe. Hopefully [Ruby
Australia](https://ruby.org.au/) will be able to revive RubyConfAU in
the not too distant future.

I also:

-   co-organised Rails Camp 17 in mid 2015
-   was privileged to present a talk entitled [*Loving Legacy
    Code*](http://keithpitty.com/blog/archives/2015-02-06-loving-legacy-code)
    at [RubyConf Australia 2015](http://rubyconf.org.au/2015)
-   was the founding President of [Ruby Australia](http://ruby.org.au).
-   co-organised [Sydney Ruby](http://ruby.org.au/meetups/syd.html)
    meetups for several years
-   led the organisation of [Rails Camp
    9](http://keithpitty.com/blog/archives/2011-06-24-rails-camp-9) in
    mid 2011
-   have presented numerous talks at Sydney and Melbourne Ruby meetups
    as well as Rails Camps
