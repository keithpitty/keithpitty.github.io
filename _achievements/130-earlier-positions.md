In my early years as a professional programmer I used technologies such
as PL/I, COBOL, IMS, CICS and DB2 on IBM mainframes. Having started in
the IT industry as a trainee programmer for TNT, I moved on to work at
IBM Australia where I gained project management experience. During 1988
and 1989, an overseas working holiday included the chance for me to work
as a contractor at Lombard North Central in Redhill, UK. Continuing
contracting on my return to Sydney, I provided services to major
corporations including IBM, Woolworths and Westpac.

From about 1992 onwards I began exploring Object-Orientation and
Internet technologies in my spare time. From an OO programming
perspective, I began with Smalltalk and later moved on to Java.
