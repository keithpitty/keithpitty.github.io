heading: Web Developer, Blake eLearning (2014 - 2015)
---

From March 2014 until June 2015 I worked for Blake eLearning as a
permanent member of their staff, allowing me to focus fully on
contributing to the development team responsible for [Reading
Eggs](http://readingeggs.com), [Reading
Eggspress](http://readingeggspress.com),
[Mathseeds](http://mathseeds.com) and
[WordFlyers](http://wordflyers.com.au).

Building upon the earlier contributions I made whilst consulting to
Blake, I:

-   reconfigured CI projects to take advantage of new Buildkite agent
    metadata and parallelism features
-   automated updating of repositories dependent on a common internal
    RubyGem
-   facilitated remote pairing via tmux and ngrok
-   contributed to the migration of a MongoDB database to PostgreSQL
-   improved the stability of several continuous integration builds
-   established a process for dealing with non-deterministic tests
-   supported the team’s use of continuous integration tools
-   developed solutions to complex problems that were adversely
    affecting customers
-   refactored code to improve readability
-   overhauled test suites to run within acceptable time frames
-   improved audit trail to facilitate easier customer support
-   assisted with resolution of numerous customer service tickets
-   developed features using Ember.js and Blake’s HTML5 framework to
    replace legacy features that relied on Flash
-   facilitated the consolidation of tools used to track project
    activities
